### **Optimized Prompt for Unique Layout Design**  

Listen carefully: Your task is to **create a fresh, visually distinct, and completely unique layout for displaying data** using an `if` statement (`{{#if}}` in Handlebars, `<?php if ?>` in PHP, etc.), ensuring all data is dynamically printed correctly.  

#### **Key Requirements:**  
1. **Innovative Layout & Structure:**  
   - Every design must have a **completely different structure** from previous versions.  
   - Change the **grid system, div hierarchy, spacing, and positioning** each time.  
   - Avoid repeating patterns in layout; explore **asymmetry, minimalism, maximalism, brutalist, futuristic, or abstract designs**.  

2. **Dynamic Conditional Logic:**  
   - Maintain **existing `{{#if}}` logic** for dynamic data rendering.  
   - Do **not** change variable names or script functionality—focus solely on **UI/UX redesign**.  

3. **Unique Visual Styling:**  
   - Use a **completely different color palette** and typography in each iteration.  
   - Apply a **new font combination** that complements the theme.  
   - Experiment with **bold, pastel, neon, monochrome, or unconventional color schemes**.  

4. **Advanced CSS for Maximum Uniqueness:**  
   - Write **extensive, modern CSS** to achieve the best possible design.  
   - Utilize **CSS Grid, Flexbox, animations, transformations, shadows, and hover effects**.  
   - Integrate **clip-path, blend modes, and custom shapes** to achieve fresh designs.  

5. **Code Constraints:**  
   - **Only provide HTML & CSS** (no JS frameworks like React/Angular).  
   - **You may use 3rd-party UI libraries** (e.g., Tailwind, Bootstrap, Bulma, Materialize) to enhance styling.  
   - Ensure the layout is **fully responsive and visually distinct from previous designs**.  

6. **UI/UX Innovation:**  
   - Improve **readability, spacing, and user experience** with each iteration.  
   - Make the **data presentation more engaging** using cards, lists, tables, or unconventional layouts.  
   - Ensure **high contrast and accessibility-friendly color choices**.  

#### **Final Output:**  
- Provide **fully functional HTML & CSS** in one go.  
- Do **not** modify the data logic—focus on **redesigning the UI**.  
- Ensure **each version looks significantly different from the last** by varying layout, colors, and typography.
